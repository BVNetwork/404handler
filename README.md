# 404 Handler for EPiServer
The popular 404 handler for EPiServer, enabling better control over your 404 page in addition to allowing redirects for old urls that no longer works.

The perfect companion if you're transitioning to EPiServer from another system and cannot keep the url structure, or plan to do major re-structuring of your content.

# Installation
`Install-Package BVN.404Handler`

The package can be found in the [EPiServer Nuget Feed](http://nuget.episerver.com/).

Until we've moved the documentation over, please check out the existing (somewhat outdated) [docs on EPiCode](https://www.coderesort.com/p/epicode/wiki/404Handler).
